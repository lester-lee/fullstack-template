Change calculator: This is an accessibility app that helps users with intellectual disabilities and other students to work at a cash register and practice counting change and having social interactions with customers.

It will be used in an education setting to help with these skills. The app is structured like a cash register! There are items in the inventory (originally modeled after a cafe) and the student/user adds items to the cart, receives a total, and then has to provide change. The app breaks this process down step by step supporting the user by calculating the change and breaking it down into denominations. Pictures provide support all the way through the process.

There are also prompts that both scaffold the process of checking out the customer and give ideas of how to interact with the customer.

\*Administrators can edit and add inventory, and add prompts to customize the experience.

This app is important because there is a wide range of individuals with disabilities that are looking for employment and math skills are a barrier. This would alleviate that barrier if used in a store. In a classroom setting it could also be used as a temporary support for some students as they practice this skill.
